######################### PANOPTES UNIT ########################################
# name:   Can be anything you want it to be. This name is displayed in several
#         places and should be a "personal" name for the unit.
#
# pan_id: This is an identification number assigned by the PANOPTES team and is
#         the official designator for your unit. This id is used to store image
#         files and communicate with the Google Cloud network.
#
#         Leave the pan_id at `PAN000` for testing until you have been assigned
#         an official id. Update pocs_local.yaml with offical name once received.

########################## Observations ########################################
# An observation folder contains a contiguous sequence of images of a target/field
# recorded by a single camera, with no slewing of the mount during the sequence; 
# there may be tracking adjustments during the observation.
#
# An example folder structure would be:
#
#   $PANDIR/images/fields/Hd189733/14d3bd/20180901T120001/
#
# In this folder will be stored JPG and FITS images. A timelapse of the
# observation can be made (one per camera) and the JPGs optionally removed
# afterward.
#
# TODO: Add options for cleaning up old data (e.g. >30 days)

######################## Google Network ########################################
# By default all images are stored on googlecloud servers and we also

#
# Options to change:
#   image_storage: If images should be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.
#   service_account_key: Location of the JSON service account key.

########################### Flat Fields ########################################
# Controls various aspects of flat fields, both for evening and morning. 
# The coordinates for the flat-field are calculated for each unit, with the
# azimuth being -180 degrees from the setting sun and the altitude being near
# the zenith (currently 70 degrees).
# 
# Note: The times at which flat-fielding will occur are controlled by the
# `location.flat_horizon` and `location.observe_horizon` config entries.
#
# take_evening_flats: If we should try to take flats during evening twilight.
# take_morning_flats: If we should try to take flats during morning twilight.
