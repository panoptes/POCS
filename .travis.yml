# Style note: we are using YAML's "literal style" block scalars for
# commands that require multiple lines, such as if-then-else-fi
# statements. For example:
#
#   - |
#     if condition-1 ; then
#       stmt-1
#       stmt-2 || alt-stmt-2
#     elif condition-2
#     then
#       stmt-3 && stmt-4
#     fi
#
# For commands that don't require multiple lines, just use the single
# line literal form, such as:
#
#   - install-some-software
#   - PATH="$PWD/some-software/bin:$PATH"
#
# When debugging errors, it is easier to determine which line was
# the source if Travis is executing them one at a time.
