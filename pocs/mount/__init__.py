def create_mount_from_config(config, mount_info=None, earth_location=None, *args, **kwargs):
    """Create a mount instance based on the provided config.

    Creates an instance of the AbstractMount sub-class in the module specified in the config.
    Specifically, the class must be in a file called pocs/mount/<DRIVER_NAME>.py,
    and the class must be called Mount.

    Args:
        config: A dictionary of name to value, as produced by `panoptes.utils.config.load_config`.
        mount_info: Optional param which overrides the 'mount' entry in config if provided.
            Useful for testing.
        earth_location: `astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation` instance, representing the
            location of the mount on the Earth. If not specified, the config must include the
            observatory's location (Latitude, Longitude and Altitude above mean sea level).
            Useful for testing.
        *args: Other positional args will be passed to the concrete class specified in the config.
        **kwargs: Other keyword args will be passed to the concrete class specified in the config.

    Returns:
        An instance of the Mount class if the config (or mount_info) is complete. `None` if neither
        mount_info nor config['mount'] is provided.

    Raises:
        `error.MountNotFound`: Missing the serial.port info for a mount which requires it (i.e. not
            a Software Bisque mount).
        `error.MountNotFound`: Wrong model, it is not bisque and serial port is not specified.
