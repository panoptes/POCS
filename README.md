# Project PANOPTES

[PANOPTES](https://www.projectpanoptes.org) is an open source citizen science project 
designed to find [transiting exoplanets](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/transits/en/) with 
digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic 
cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools (or anyone!) in order to monitor, 
as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more general information 
about the project, including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the 
[project overview](https://projectpanoptes.org/articles/).

# POCS

POCS (PANOPTES Observatory Control System) is the main software driver for a 
PANOPTES unit, responsible for high-level control of the unit. 

For more information, see the full documentation at: https://pocs.readthedocs.io.

[`panoptes-utils`](https://www.github.com/panoptes/panoptes-utils) is a related repository and POCS
relies on most of the tools within `panoptes-utils`.

## Install

### POCS Environment

If you are running a PANOPTES unit then you will most likely want an entire PANOPTES environment.

There is a bash shell script that will install an entire working POCS system on your computer.  Some 
folks even report that it works on a Mac.

The script will ask if you want to install in "developer" mode or not. If so, you should fork this repo, [panoptes-utils](https://github.com/panoptes/panoptes-utils), and [panoptes-tutorials](https://github.com/panoptes/panoptes-tutorials),
and then give your github username when prompted.

The non-developer mode of the script is intended for PANOPTES units.
   

To install POCS via the script, open a terminal and enter:

```bash
curl -L https://install.projectpanoptes.org | bash
```

Or using `wget`:

```bash
wget -O - https://install.projectpanoptes.org | bash
```


### POCS Module

If you want just the POCS module, for instance if you want to override it in
your own OCS (see [Huntsman-POCS](https://github.com/AstroHuntsman/huntsman-pocs)
for an example), then install via `pip`:

```bash
pip install panoptes-pocs
```

If you want the extra features, such as Google Cloud Platform connectivity, then
use the extras options:

```bash
pip install "panoptes-pocs[google,testing]"
```
