PANOPTES Overview
=================

PANOPTES is driven primarily by an open source model with regards to both
software and data. In addition, the goal has always been to create an entire
"scientific platform" that could be used for educational purposes. Because
modern scientific practices usually include some component of software
development [1]_, one of the early design goals for the project was to have a
software base that was not only completely open source but also easily
readable (and modifiable) by individuals just learning how to program.

Importantly, the software must also be accurate and robust in order to handle
long-term unattended and remote operations and must also be customizable based
on potential hardware differences between units.

The PANOPTES `code repositories <https://github.com/panoptes>`_ can therefore
be used in two different contexts: automatically by installed hardware units
responsible for collecting data; and interactively by developers, including
students and amateurs, who can choose to modify existing operations, add new
functionality, or simply use the software as a learning tool for astronomy and
software development. The two distinct but equally important uses of the 
software, one as an automatic observatory control system (OCS) for data 
collection and the other as a tool for learning, place unique constraints on 
the decisions made regarding software. I have designed and written all 
software with these overarching goals in mind.
