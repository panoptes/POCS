PANOPTES Observatory Control System - 	POCS
============================================

.. warning::
	Documentation under construction.


`PANOPTES <http://projectpanoptes.org>`_ is an open source citizen science
project that is designed to find exoplanets with digital cameras. The goal of
PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur
astronomers and schools in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a
very large number of stars. For more general information about the project,
including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the
`project website <http://projectpanoptes.org/>`_.

.. seealso::

	This is the documentation for the software that controls a running 
	PANOPTES robotic observatory. This will mostly be useful for developers 
	working on the control software itself. Normal operating usage of POCS 
	doesn't require knowledge of the documentation here.

	If you are interested in how to operate a PANOPTES unit, please see the 
	`User's Guide <https://projectpanoptes.org/instructions.html>`_.
