`PANOPTES <http://projectpanoptes.org>`_ is an open source citizen science project that is designed to find exoplanets with digital cameras. The goal of PANOPTES is to establish a global network of of robotic cameras run by amateur astronomers and schools in order to monitor, as continuously as possible, a very large number of stars. For more general information about the project, including the science case and resources for interested individuals, see the `project website <http://projectpanoptes.org/>`_ for an overview.

	This is the documentation for the software that controls a running PANOPTES
	unit. This will mostly be useful for developers working on the control software
	itself. Normal operating usage of POCS doesn't require knowledge of the
	documentation here. 

	If you are intereted in how to operate a PANOPTES unit, please see the `User's Guide <https://projectpanoptes.org/instructions.html>`_.
