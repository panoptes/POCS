POCS Documentation
==================

https://panoptes-pocs.readthedocs.io/en/develop/

The documentation is hosted on ReadTheDocs and does not need to be
be build locally. If you wish, you can:

```
cd $POCS/docs
make html
```

which will output html files in `$POCS/docs/_build/html`.

Todo:
	Add ability to generate pdf via `make pdf`.
