==================
CONTRIBUTING GUIDE
==================

Please see the `code of
conduct <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__
for our playground rules and follow them during all your contributions.

Getting Started
===============

We prefer that all changes to POCS have an associated `GitHub Issue in
the project <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/issues>`__ that explains
why it is needed. This allows us to debate the best approach to address
the issue before folks spend a lot of time writing code. If you are
unsure about a possible contribution to the project, please contact the
project owners about your idea; of course, an
`issue <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/issues>`__ is a good way to do
this.

Pull Request Process
====================

.. note::

    This is a summary of the process. See the `POCS wiki <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/wiki/PANOPTES-Feature-Development-Process>`_ for more info.

-  Pre-requisites
-  Ensure you have a `github account. <https://github.com/join>`__
-  `Setup ssh access for
   github <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`__.
-  If the change you wish to make is not already an `Issue in the
   project <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/issues>`__, please create
   one specifying the need.

Process
^^^^^^^

1.  Create a fork of the repository via github (button in top-right).
2.  Clone your fork to your local system:

    .. code-block::
        bash

        cd $PANDIR
        git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-NAME/POCS.git

3.  Set the "upstream" branch to ``panoptes`` and fetch the upstream changes:

    .. code-block::
        bash

        cd POCS
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/panoptes/POCS.git
        git fetch upstream

4.  Use a topic branch within your fork to make changes. All of our repositories
    have a default branch of ``develop`` when you first clone them, but your work
    should be in a separate branch (see note below). Your branch should be based
    off of the ``upstream/develop`` branch.

    Create a branch with a descriptive name, e.g.:

    .. code-block::
        bash

        git checkout -b new-camera-simulator upstream/develop
        git checkout -b issue-28 upstream/develop

5.  Ensure that your code meets this project's standards (see Testing and Code
    Formatting below).

6. Run the testing suite locally to ensure that all tests are passing. See Testing below.

7. Submit a pull request to the repository, be sure to reference the issue number it addresses.

.. note::

    See `"A successful Git branching model" <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__
    for details on how the repository is structured.


Code Formatting
===============

-  All Python should use `PEP 8
   Standards <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__
-  Line length is set at 100 characters instead of 80.
-  It is recommended to have your editor auto-format code whenever you
   save a file rather than attempt to go back and change an entire file
   all at once. There are many plugins that exist for this.
-  You can also use `yapf (Yet Another Python
   Formatter) <https://github.com/google/yapf>`__ for which POCS
   includes a style file (.style.yapf). For example::

       # cd to the root of your workspace.
       cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
       # Format the modified python files in your workspace.
       yapf -i $(git diff --name-only | egrep '\.py$')``

-  Do not leave in commented-out code or unnecessary whitespace.
-  Variable/function/class and file names should be meaningful and
   descriptive.
-  File names should be lower case and underscored, not contain spaces.
   For example, ``my_file.py`` instead of ``My File.py``.
-  Define any project specific terminology or abbreviations you use in
   the file you use them.

Log Messages
============

Use appropriate logging:

* DEBUG (i.e. ``self.logger.debug()``) should attempt to capture all run*time information.

* INFO (i.e. ``self.logger.info()``) should be used sparingly and meant to convey information to a person actively watching a running unit.

* WARNING (i.e. ``self.logger.warning()``) should alert when something does not go as expected but operation of unit can continue.

* ERROR (i.e. ``self.logger.error()``) should be used at critical levels when operation cannot continue.

* The logger supports variable information without the use of the ``format`` method.

* There is a ``say`` method available on the main ``POCS`` class that is meant to be used in friendly manner to convey information to a user. This should be used only for personable output and is typically displayed in the "chat box"of the PAWS website. These messages are also sent to the INFO level logger.

Logging examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note: These are meant to illustrate the logging calls and are not
necessarily indicative of real operation*

.. code-block::
    python

    self.say("I'm all ready to go, first checking the weather")

    self.logger.info(f'PANOPTES unit initialized: {self.name}')

    self.logger.debug("Setting up weather station")

    self.logger.warning(f'Problem getting wind safety: {e!r}')

    self.logger.debug(f'Rain: {is_raining} Clouds: {is_cloudy} Dark: {is_dark} Temp: {temp:.02f}')

    self.logger.error('Unable to connect to AAG Cloud Sensor, cannot continue')

Viewing log files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  You typically want to follow an active log file by using ``tail -F``
   on the command line.

.. code-block:: bash

    tail -F $PANDIR/logs/panoptes.log


Test POCS
=========

POCS comes with a testing suite that allows it to test that all of the software
works and is installed correctly. Running the test suite by default will use simulators for all of the hardware and is meant to test that
the software works correctly. Additionally, the testing suite can be run
with various flags to test that attached hardware is working properly.

Software Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few scenarios where you want to run the test suite:

#. You are getting your unit ready and want to test software is
   installed correctly.
#. You are upgrading to a new release of software (POCS, its
   dependencies or the operating system).
#. You are helping develop code for POCS and want test your code doesn't
   break something.

Testing your installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to test your installation you should have followed all of the steps above
for getting your unit ready. To run the test suite, you will need to open a terminal
and navigate to the ``$POCS`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $POCS

    # Run the software testing
    panoptes-develop test

.. note::

    The test suite will give you some warnings about what is going
    on and give you a chance to cancel the tests (via ``Ctrl-c``).

It is often helpful to view the log output in another terminal window
while the test suite is running:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Follow the log file
    tail -F $PANDIR/logs/panoptes.log

Testing your code changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    This step is meant for people helping with software development.

The testing suite will automatically be run against any code committed to our github
repositories. However, the test suite should also be run locally before pushing
to github. This can be done either by running the entire test suite as above or
by running an individual test related to the code you are changing. For instance,
to test the code related to the cameras one can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -xv pocs/tests/test_camera.py

Here the ``-x`` option will stop the tests upon the first failure and the ``-v`` makes
the testing verbose.
Note that some tests might require additional software. This software is
installed in the docker image, which is used by the ``test-software.sh``
script above), but is **not** used when calling ``pytest`` directly. For
instance, anything requiring plate solving needs ``astrometry.net``
installed.

Any new code should also include proper tests. See below for details.

Writing tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All code changes should include tests. We strive to maintain a high code coverage
and new code should necessarily maintain or increase code coverage.
For more details see the `Writing
Tests <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/wiki/Writing-Tests-for-POCS>`__
page.

Hardware Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware testing uses the same testing suite as the software testing but with
additional options passed on the command line to signify what hardware should be
tested.

The options to pass to ``pytest`` is ``--with-hardware``, which accepts a list of
possible hardware items that are connected. This list includes ``camera``, ``mount``,
and ``weather``. Optionally you can use ``all`` to test a fully connected unit.

.. warning::

    The hardware tests do not perform safety checking of the weather or
    dark sky. The ``weather`` test mentioned above tests if a weather station is
    connected but does not test the safety conditions. It is assumed that hardware
    testing is always done with direct supervision.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Test an attached camera
    pytest --with-hardware=camera

    # Test an attached camera and mount
    pytest --with-hardware=camera,mount

    # Test a fully connected unit
    pytest --with-hardware=all
