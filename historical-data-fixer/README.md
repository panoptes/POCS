# Historical Data Fixer

During 2014 and 2015, sensor data changed a little bit, but we still
want to load it into BigQuery so that we can learn more about the
environment of PANOPTES units over time.

This directory contains some scripts that inspect historical data
and prepare it for import into Google BigQuery
