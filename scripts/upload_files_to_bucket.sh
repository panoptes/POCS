# For more information, see documentation at:

# Note:
# The SEARCH_PATH and DESTINATION are often similar. Normal invocation
# is done via $POCS/scripts/upload_image_dir.py. See also the utils in
# $POCS/pocs/utils/google/storage.py.
#
# Note:
# The SEARCH_PATH can be any pattern, e.g:
#     - 'PAN006'  # All images for unit
#     - 'Hd189733'  # All images for field
#     - 'PAN006/Hd189733/7bab97' # All images for unit, field, camera
#     - 'PAN006/*/7bab97' # All images for unit, camera
#     - 'PAN006/Hd189733/7bab97/20180327T071126/' # Specific observation
