# gphoto2 enables remote control of cameras, including the Canon DSLRs that
# Panoptes uses. This includes changing many settings and taking pictures.
# We are currently using the published linux package, but that can be quite
# old relative to the latest stable version. gphoto2-updater is an install
# script that we might want to use if we need a newer version. For more info,
# see: https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater
# There is an old conda package.
